# WebStudio

WebStudio is a two-page website project I created as my first frontend project.
It represents a fictional team of designers offering creative services.

This project helped me practice HTML, SCSS, and a little JavaScript, all without a bundler. It was built with a focus on clean layout, responsive design, and with semantic structure.
